- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PHofHP, located in California.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a guitar and fretless bass player, and am interested mostly in Trad jazz tunes (Real Book, etc.) and some classic rock.
- - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about diminished scales and using dim chords to substitute for 7thb9 chords.
  - I'm about 200 pages into the complete Mel Bay Complete Method for Modern Guitar (7 volume set in one book). I originally studied guitar using the Mel Bay series when I was 15 years old.
  - I'm a retiree now, and play in a Church Band.
  I use Band In A Box and Cakewalk, and just started trying out Jamulus to try to collaborate with a remote friend who is near Toronto.
